## Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)

To understand what LCA is let's take the below image as example:-

![LCA tree][/images/lca-tree-example.png]

The above tree is an example of a rooted tree with 10 vertices and rooted at node number 0. You may verify manually that 
LCA(4,5) = 3,
LCA(4,6) = 1,
LCA(4,1) = 1, 
LCA(8,9) = 7 and LCA(4,8) = 0.
Throughout this article we will assume to denote the total number of nodes in the tree.
