## Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)

To understand what LCA is let's take the below image as example:-

![LCA tree](/images/lca-tree-example.png)

The above tree is an example of a rooted tree with 10 vertices and rooted at node number 0. You may verify manually that 
LCA(4,5) = 3,
LCA(4,6) = 1,
LCA(4,1) = 1, 
LCA(8,9) = 7 and LCA(4,8) = 0.
Throughout this article we will assume to denote N the total number of nodes in the tree.

### Naive Algorithm for finding the LCA:

Time Complexity Per Query: O(N)

A naive solution consists of two steps: From the first vertex , we go all the way up to the of the tree and record all the vertices traversed along the way . From the second vertex , we also go all the way up to the root of the tree , but this time we stop if we encounter a common vertex for the first time . This common vertex is the LCA. For example, if we want to compute LCA(4,6) of the tree in the figure of the tree given above in this article using this naive solution, we will first traverse the path 

`4 -> 3 -> 1 -> 0`

and mark these 4 vertices as visited.

*Step 1:-*

![LCA Naive approach step 1](/images/lca-naive-approach-step1.jpg)

*Step 2:-*

![LCA Naive approach step 2](/images/lca-naive-approach-step2.jpg)

 *Nodes visited in Step 1 are marked in green*

 Then we start our traversal from the second vertex of the the query 6 and traverse along the path 

 `6->1`

 We stop our traversal at node `1` because this is in the path from the first vertex to the root . Hence , the paths of `4` to `root` and `6` to `root` intersect for the first time at node `1`.As the traversal of the nodes is such that the distance of the nodes from the keeps decreasing as the traversal continues , We can say node is the node `1` farthest from the `root` that is an ancestor of nodes `4` and `6`. Hence , LCA(4,6) = 1.

This algorithm takes total time complexity of `O(h)`, where h is the maximum distance of the root from a leaf, in worst case, it will be equal to `N`. 

*Code:-*

```
int parent[MAX_NODES];                  /*Keeps track of the parent of every vertex in the tree*/
bool visited[MAX_NODES];                
vector<vector<int> > tree[MAX_NODES];   /*The tree is stored as an undirected graph using an adjacency list*/



/*GetParents() function traverses the tree and computes the parent array such that
The pre-order traversal begins by calling GetParents(root_node,-1) */
void GetParents(int node , int par){       
    for(int i = 0 ; i < tree[node].size() ; ++i){
        /*As this is a pre-order traversal of the tree the parent of the current    node has already been processed*/
        Thus it should not be processed again*/
        if(tree[node][i] != par){
            parent[tree[node][i]] = node ; 
            GetParents(tree[node][i] , node) ; 
        }
    }
}


/*Computes the LCA of nodes u and v . */
int LCA(int u , int v){
    /*traverse from node u uptil root node and mark the vertices encountered along the path . */
    int lca ; 
    while(1){
        visited[u] = true ; 
        if(u == root_node){
            break ; 
        }
        u = parent[u] ; 
    }

    /*Now traverse from node v and keep going up untill we dont hit a node that is in the path of node u to root node*/
    while(1){
        if(visited[v]){ /*Intersection of paths found at this node.*/
            lca = v;    
            break ;  
        }
        v = parent[v] ; 
    }
    return lca ; 
}
```


### LCA Using Square-Root Decomposition:

*Time Complexity for Preprocessing: O(N)*
*Time Complexity for answering each query: O(sqrt(N))*

In naive approach we were jumping one parent up the tree till both nodes arenâ€™t on the same depth. But here we perform group wise jump. To perform this group wise jump, we need two parameter associated with each node : 

1) parent and 

2) jump parent


Here parent for each node is defined as the first node above the current node that is directly connected to it, where as jump_parent for each node is the node that is the first ancestor of the current node in the group just above the current node.

The key concept here is that first we bring both the nodes in same group and having same jump_parent by climbing decomposed blocks above the tree one by one and then when both the nodes are in same group and have same jump_parent we use our naive approach to find LCA of the nodes.

This optimized group jumping technique reduces the iterating space by a factor of `sqrt(h)` and hence reduces the Time Complexity(refer below for better time complexity analysis)

*Calculate the jump parent as array P, code:-*

```
int parent[MAX_NODES] , level[MAX_NODES] , P[MAX_NODES];
vector<vector<int> > tree[MAX_NODES];

void traverse(int node , int head ,int prev_section){
    /*head stores the node that is in the same level as the current node
    And is its ancestor*/
    int current_section =  sqrt(level[node]) + 1; 
    if(current_section == 1){
        P[node] = 1 ; 
    }
    else{
        if(current_section == prev_section + 1){
            P[node] = parent[node] ; 
            head = node ; 
        }
        else{
            P[node] = parent[head] ; 
        }
    }
    for(int i = 0 ; i < tree[node].size() ; ++i){
        if(tree[node][i] != parent[node]){
            traverse(tree[node][i] ,head ,current_section) ; 
        }
    }
}

```


After this precomputation coding of LCA becomes easier. Let's say we need to find LCA for u and v. At each step two cases may occur:-

*Case 1:-* P[u] != P[v]. In this case we pick the node at a greater depth and update its value to node = P[node] and then carry the process further. Each such movement takes time because of the precomputation that we made earlier. 

*Case 2:-* P[u] == P[v]. In this case it is guaranteed that the LCA of the two nodes is either P[u] or some node at a lower level/greater depth than P[u]. Thus in such a case we can keep picking the node at the greater depth at each step and move it one unit upwards i.e. node = parent[node] . As the distance of P[u] from either nodes is less than or equal to O(sqrt(N)) , this process takes O(sqrt(N)) time in the worst case. 

*Code to calculate LCA:-*

```
void LCA(int u , int v){
    while(P[u] != P[v]){
        if(level[u] > level[v]){
            u = P[u];
        }
        else{
            v = P[v]; 
        }
    }
    while(u != v){
        if(level[u] > level[v]){
            u = parent[u] ; 
        }
        else{
            v = parent[v] ;
        }
    }
    return u ; //Either u or v store the lca. 
}

```


### LCA using Sparse Table

*Precomputation :* O(NlogN)

*Answering each query :* O(logN)

In this method the precomputation step would consist of calculating the 2^ith ancestor for all valid i for each node. To do this we would be using sparse table. This technique is to find the kth ancestor for a node in a tree also known as *binary raise technique*. We would be precomputing a 2D table P such that P[i][j] stores the 2^jth ancestor for node i. 

*Precomputation Sparse table code:-*

```
//P[i][j] stores the 2^j th ancestor of node i 
int P[MAX_NODES][MAX_LOG] , parent[MAX_NODES];

void preprocess(){
    //Every element in P[][] is -1 initially; 
    for(int i = 1 ; i <= N ; ++i){
        for(int j = 0 ; (1<<j) < N ; ++i){
            P[i][j] = -1; 
        }
    }

    //The first ancestor(2^0 th ancestor)
    //for every node is parent[node]
    // and we can get parent node for each node by running a 
    // dfs from root node
    for(int i = 1 ; i <= N ; ++i){
        P[i][0] = parent[i] ; 
    }

    for(int j = 1; (1<<j) < N ; ++j){
        for(int i = 1 ; i <= N ; ++i){
            //If a node does not have a (2^(j-1))th ancestor
            //Then it does not have a (2^j)th ancestor
            //and hence P[i][j] should remain -1
            //Else the (2^j)th ancestor of node i
            //is the (2^(j-1))th ancestor of ((2^(j-1))th ancestor of node i)
            if(P[i][j-1] != -1){
                P[i][j] = P[P[i][j-1]][j-1] ; 
            }
        }
    }
} 
```


The above code clearly takes O(NlogN) time and O(NlogN) space.

Let us assume that we are given two nodes u and v such that level[u] = level[v]. Hence their LCA would be at the same distance, let's say k above them.
Hence LCA(u,v) = kth ancestor of u = kth ancestor of v. In case they are not on same level, then we can easily get the lowest node to the same level as top node.

*LCA using sparse table calculation:-*

```
int LCA(int u , int v){
    if(level[u] < level[v]){
        swap(u,v) ;     
    }
    //u is the node at a greater depth/lower level
    //So we have to raise u to be at the same
    //level as v. 
    int dist = level[u] - level[v] ; 
    while(dist > 0){
        int raise_by = log2(dist);
        u = P[u][raise_by];
        dist -= (1<<raise_by) ; 
    }

    if(u == v){
        return u ; 
    }

    //Now we keep raising the two nodes by equal amount
    //Untill each node has been raised uptill its (k-1)th ancestor
    //Such that the (k)th ancestor is the lca. 
    //So to get the lca we just return the parent of (k-1)th ancestor 
    //of each node

    for(int j = MAXLOG ; j >= 0 ; --j){
        //Checking P[u][j] != P[v][j] because if P[u][j] == P[v][j]
        //P[u][j] would be the Lth ancestor such that (L >= k) 
        //where kth ancestor is the LCA
        //But we want the (k-1)th ancestor. 
        if((P[u][j] != -1) and (P[u][j] != P[v][j])){
            u = P[u][j] ; 
            v = P[v][j] ; 
        }
    }
    return parent[u] ; //or parent[v]
}   
```

In the worst case this function takes at most 2 * MAXLOG operations where MAXLOG = log maxheight. In the worst case, maxheight = N. Hence this function is O(logN) in the worst case.
