## Supervised Learning

Supervised Learning is where the data is labeled and the program learns to predict the output from the input data. 

 For instance, a supervised learning algorithm for credit card fraud detection would take as input a set of recorded transactions. For each transaction, the program would predict if it is fraudulent or not.

Supervised learning problems can be further grouped into regression and classification problems.

### Regression:

In regression problems, we are trying to predict a continuous-valued output. Examples are:

    What is the housing price in Neo York?
    What is the value of cryptocurrencies?

### Classification:

In classification problems, we are trying to predict a discrete number of values. Examples are:

    Is this a picture of a human or a picture of an AI?
    Is this email spam?

## Unsupervised Learning 

Unsupervised Learning is a type of machine learning where the program learns the inherent structure of the data based on unlabeled examples.

`Clustering` is a common unsupervised machine learning approach that finds patterns and structures in unlabeled data by grouping them into clusters.

Some examples:

 1. Social networks clustering topics in their news feed
 2. Consumer sites clustering users for recommendations
 3. Search engines to group similar objects in one cluster
